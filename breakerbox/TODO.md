Service
-------
1. Stop using an iframe for the Hystrix-dashboard, we can serve it up directly.
2. Frontend adjustments for the configure page. Saving and refreshing is quite jarring when you have a large list of hosts.
3. Fix problem with Turbine breaking on chunked-encoded streams.
4. Create configuration from already advertised configurations on services.

Jdbi
-----
Currently supports H2/Postgres out of the box.

1. Officially add MySQL support.

Azure
-----
1. Upgrade Azure client to latest.
2. Generate a decent Mock for Azure Table. For now they are all @Ignored if you don't have valid Azure Table credentials.
